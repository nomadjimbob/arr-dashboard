# API Routes Reference

> Reference documentation extracted from CLAUDE.md for detailed deep dives into the API route structure.

All routes in `apps/api/src/routes/`. Protected routes use preHandler authentication.

## Route Surface Governance

Every top-level route group is registered through a single manifest at
[`apps/api/src/routes/route-manifest.ts`](../apps/api/src/routes/route-manifest.ts).
The manifest assigns each group a **maturity tier** that tells contributors
how careful they need to be when changing it.

| Tier | Audience | Change discipline |
|---|---|---|
| **stable** | Bundled web UI **and** potential external scripts/integrations | Preserve request/response shape within a minor version. Breaking changes need a CHANGELOG entry and (if user-visible) a release-notes call-out. |
| **operator** | Self-hosting operator (single-admin) via the UI or scripted ops | Real-world side effects (restart, restore, configure providers). Treat behavior changes as user-visible; document in CHANGELOG. |
| **internal** | Bundled dashboard only — frontend ships in lockstep | Free to reshape as long as the matching frontend code is updated in the same PR. No external compatibility promise. |
| **experimental** | Opt-in / iterating | May move or be removed. Mark loudly in release notes if surfaced in the UI. |

This is **not** a semantic API versioning scheme. The app remains
single-admin and self-hosted; the tiers exist to set reviewer expectations,
not to gate routing. See
[`docs/adr/0004-route-surface-governance.md`](adr/0004-route-surface-governance.md)
for the full rationale.

### Public route groups

| Path | Maturity | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | stable | Liveness/readiness probes for orchestrators |
| `/auth` | stable | Password login, registration, account management |
| `/auth/oidc` | stable | OIDC initiate + callback |
| `/auth/passkey` | stable | WebAuthn registration + assertion |

### Protected route groups

| `/api/auto-tag` | operator | Criteria-based auto-tagger — applies tags to LibraryCache items matching the rule's criteria DSL (genre, year, codec, watch state, …). Companion to Label Sync. Webhook config (secret read/rotate) lives here under session auth. |
| `/api/auto-tag/webhook` | operator | Inbound Sonarr/Radarr Connect webhook for real-time auto-tagging. **Public route** (no session cookie); authenticates via per-user Bearer token (SHA-256 hash of the user's webhook secret). |
| `/api/pulse` | internal | System Pulse health signals + attention items |

| `/api/qui` | stable | Federated peer integration with autobrr/qui (qBittorrent UI) — torrent state, trackers, cross-seed siblings, and capability-aware torrent mutations; powers the Torrent Health panel and detail drawer. |
| `/api/webhooks/qui` | stable | Inbound qui Shoutrrr notification receiver (Phase 5.1). **Public route** (no session cookie); authenticates via a per-user `?secret=…` query param forwarded by the generic target. Normalizes qUI's `{title, message}` JSON, stores it in `QuiEventLog`, and publishes to the in-process event bus for SSE fan-out. |
| `/api/tracearr` | experimental | Tracearr integration (charter §2.2 / ADR-0007) — typed Public API reads for health, streams, history, stats, activity, users, and violations, plus stream termination. Powers the Console live-session card and Statistics analytics; instance CRUD and connection testing run through `/api/services`. |
| `/api/seerr` | stable | Request management, discovery, library enrichment |
| `/api/trash-guides` | operator | TRaSH cache, templates, deployment, profiles |

> When you add a new route group, add a manifest entry **and** a row above.
> A contract test (`apps/api/src/routes/__tests__/route-manifest.test.ts`)
> will fail loudly if either is missing.

## Per-group route detail

## Tautulli Routes (`/api/tautulli`)

Tautulli routes return only Tautulli-derived data. They do not read Tracearr
or native live-session state. Titles, usernames, labels, and URLs remain
sensitive client fields; incognito-aware consumers must use the existing
incognito helpers before rendering them.

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| GET | `/api/tautulli/activity` | Yes | Source-scoped active sessions, bandwidth totals, and per-instance reachability |
| GET | `/api/tautulli/stats?timeRange=` | Yes | Source-scoped Tautulli home rankings and user watch statistics with explicit ranking limits and completeness metadata |
| GET | `/api/tautulli/stats/plays-by-date?timeRange=` | Yes | Source-scoped Tautulli play-count time series |
| GET | `/api/tautulli/history?offset=&limit=` | Yes | Independently paginated newest-first history for each source; `offset + limit` is bounded to 5,000 records and completeness is explicit |
| GET | `/api/tautulli/cache/:instanceId/status` | Yes | Owned-instance cache count and durable refresh witness |
| GET | `/api/tautulli/cache/health` | Yes | Cache health for the current user's enabled Tautulli instances, including successful-generation and latest-attempt/effective-result metadata |
| POST | `/api/tautulli/cache/:instanceId/refresh` | Yes | Rate-limited owned-instance refresh through the guarded cache refresher |

## Guided Setup Routes (`/api/setup`)

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/setup/discovery` | Yes | Discover Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby candidates without saving or connecting them |
| GET | `/api/setup/starters` | Yes | Preview available, disabled starter automation drafts and existing matches |
| POST | `/api/setup/starters` | Yes | Idempotently create explicitly selected starter drafts in a disabled state |

## Authentication Routes (`/auth`)

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| GET | `/auth/setup-required` | No | Check if setup needed |
| POST | `/auth/register` | No | Initial user creation |
| POST | `/auth/login` | No | Password login |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Yes | End session |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Yes | Current user info |
| PATCH | `/auth/account` | Yes | Update username/password/TMDB key |
| DELETE | `/auth/password` | Yes | Remove password (requires OIDC) |
| DELETE | `/auth/account` | Yes | Delete account (no auth methods) |

## OIDC Routes (`/auth/oidc`)

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| GET | `/auth/oidc/providers` | No | Get configured provider |
| POST | `/auth/oidc/setup` | No | Configure during setup |
| POST | `/auth/oidc/login` | No | Initiate OIDC flow |
| GET | `/auth/oidc/callback` | No | Handle provider callback |

## Passkey Routes (`/auth/passkey`)

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| POST | `/passkey/register/options` | Yes | Generate registration challenge |
| POST | `/passkey/register/verify` | Yes | Complete registration |
| POST | `/passkey/login/options` | No | Generate auth challenge |
| POST | `/passkey/login/verify` | No | Complete authentication |
| GET | `/passkey/credentials` | Yes | List user passkeys |
| DELETE | `/passkey/credentials` | Yes | Delete passkey |
| PATCH | `/passkey/credentials` | Yes | Rename passkey |

## Service Management (`/api/services`)

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET | `/services` | List all instances |
| POST | `/services` | Add instance |
| PUT | `/services/:id` | Update instance; accepts body field `confirmAnalyticsUnavailableFor: "<provider>"` only when confirming selected-provider unavailability |
| DELETE | `/services/:id` | Remove instance; accepts `?confirmAnalyticsUnavailableFor=<provider>` only when confirming selected-provider unavailability |
| POST | `/services/test-connection` | Test before saving |
| POST | `/services/:id/test` | Test existing |

When an update or deletion would leave the selected historical analytics provider family unavailable, the route returns HTTP 409 with exactly `{ code: "ANALYTICS_PROVIDER_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED", selected, alternativeEnabled }`. Clients may retry the identical lifecycle change once with `confirmAnalyticsUnavailableFor` set to that `selected` provider. The route recomputes the topology at execution time and returns a fresh 409 if the selected provider changed; the selected provider family remains selected and no automatic switch occurs.

## QUI Routes (`/api/qui`) — experimental

> Federated peer integration with autobrr/qui (qBittorrent UI) — read-only torrent state, trackers, cross-seed siblings.

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| GET | `/qui/instances` | Yes | List QUI instances for current user |
| GET | `/qui/instances/:id/qbit` | Yes | List qBittorrent instances behind a QUI instance |
| GET | `/qui/instances/:id/torrents/by-hash/:hash` | Yes | Get torrent by info hash |
| GET | `/qui/instances/:id/qbit/:instanceId/torrents/:hash/trackers` | Yes | Get trackers for a torrent (filters DHT/PeX/LSD) |
| GET | `/qui/instances/:id/qbit/:instanceId/torrents/:hash/cross-seed` | Yes | Get cross-seed matches for a torrent |
| POST | `/qui/instances/:id/test` | Yes | Test connection to a saved QUI instance |
| POST | `/qui/test` | Yes | Test connection with inline credentials (no storage) |

The Library route (`GET /api/library`) accepts `?torrentState=` for server-side filtering (Phase 2.1). Allowed values: `all` (default), `none` (rows without qui data yet), `seeding`, `downloading`, `stalled_dl`, `paused`, `queued`, `checking`, `moving`, `error`, `unknown`. State is populated by the periodic `qui-torrent-state-sync` scheduler (10 min). The response also includes a `torrentStateCounts` object (per-state counts honoring every other applied filter) so the UI dropdown can show `Seeding (150)` etc.

**Backfill coverage**: the `infohash-backfill` scheduler walks LibraryCache rows missing `infoHash`, queries the relevant *arr's dedicated `/api/v3/history/movie` (Radarr) or `/api/v3/history/series` (Sonarr) endpoint for the original grab record, and persists the hash. **Two-phase cadence**:

- **Catch-up phase** runs at startup whenever the backlog is non-zero — fires batches back-to-back with a 60s gap, capped at 10k rows per startup (~17 min worst-case). Drains an existing library quickly: a 1500-row backlog completes in ~5 minutes.
- **Steady-state phase** takes over after catch-up, running every 6h to capture any new items that have landed since the last sweep.

Per-row sleep is 100ms regardless of phase — that's the politeness budget against *arr. Without this scheduler, only items grabbed since PR #416 (2026-05-04) ever get correlated with qui. The base `/api/v3/history` endpoint is intentionally NOT used: it accepts `movieIds`/`seriesIds` (plural arrays) and silently ignores the singular form, returning unfiltered global history that would assign the same hash to every item.

## Dashboard (`/api/dashboard`)

| Route | Purpose | Refresh |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/dashboard/queue` | Download queue | 30s |
| `/dashboard/history` | Download history | 60s |
| `/dashboard/calendar` | Upcoming releases | 60s |
| `/dashboard/statistics` | Aggregate stats | 120s |

each proposed or executed action.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GET | `/library-cleanup/activity` | Paginated action timelines with a bounded recent-event window |
