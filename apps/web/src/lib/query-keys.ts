/**
 * Centralized React Query key factory.
 *
 * Every query key in the application should be defined here so that:
 * 1. Invalidation targets are type-safe and never out of sync
 * 2. Duplicate key definitions are eliminated
 * 3. Broad invalidation (e.g. "all library queries") is one import away
 *
 * Convention:
 * - `all`        → readonly tuple for broad invalidation
 * - named static → readonly tuple for a specific query
 * - functions    → return a readonly tuple for parameterised queries
